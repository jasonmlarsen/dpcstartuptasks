# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## DPC Startup Task Manager

---

### 1. Overview

The DPC Startup Task Manager is a collaborative, multi-tenant task management tool designed specifically for Direct Primary Care (DPC) clinic founders. It provides a clean, minimal experience for teams of up to 3 users per clinic to manage a preloaded set of categorized tasks that guide them through launching their clinic.

**This tool is also designed as a lead magnet** for the broader *DirectCareTools.com* platform. By offering this high-value tool for free, it builds trust and engagement with potential clinic owners while collecting qualified email leads for future marketing and product offerings.

#### 13.1 Security Best Practices

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Implement RLS on all database tables to ensure users can only access data within their organization
  - Organizations table: Users can only see their own organization
  - Users table: Users can only see other users within their organization
  - Tasks table: Users can only access tasks belonging to their organization
  - Comments table: Users can only access comments on tasks within their organization
- **Secure Authentication**: 
  - Enforce strong password policies (minimum 8 characters, mix of letters/numbers/symbols)
  - Secure handling of authentication tokens with proper expiration
  - Consider MFA as future enhancement
- **Input Validation**: 
  - Robust server-side validation on all API endpoints
  - Client-side validation for user experience
  - Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
- **Authorization Checks**: All API endpoints must verify user permissions before data access/modification
- **Rate Limiting**: 
  - Authentication endpoints: 5 attempts per minute per IP
  - API endpoints: 100 requests per minute per user
  - Task creation: 50 tasks per hour per user
- **Secure Communication**: All traffic must use HTTPS in production
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security updates for all third-party libraries
- **Error Handling**: Generic error messages in production to avoid information leakage
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with proper timeout and invalidation

#### 13.2 Performance Optimization

**Database Performance:**
- **Indexing Strategy**:
  - Primary indexes on all foreign keys (organization_id, user_id, task_id)
  - Composite index on (organization_id, created_at) for task listing
  - Index on (organization_id, completed) for filtering completed tasks
  - Index on (organization_id, due_date) for date-based queries
  - Index on (organization_id, assigned_to) for user-specific task queries
- **Query Optimization**:
  - Use SELECT with specific columns instead of SELECT *
  - Implement pagination for task lists (50 tasks per page)
  - Use database-level filtering instead of client-side filtering
  - Avoid N+1 queries by using proper JOINs or batch queries

**Frontend Performance:**
- **Code Splitting**: Implement route-based code splitting for faster initial load
- **Lazy Loading**: Load task details and comments on demand
- **Bundle Optimization**: 
  - Tree shaking to remove unused code
  - Minification and compression of assets
  - Separate vendor bundles for better caching
- **Image Optimization**: 
  - Use WebP format where supported
  - Implement responsive images for different screen sizes
  - Compress all images to appropriate quality levels
- **Caching Strategy**:
  - Browser caching for static assets (CSS, JS, images)
  - API response caching for relatively static data (user profiles, organization info)
  - Service worker for offline-first experience (future enhancement)

**API Performance:**
- **Response Optimization**: Send only required data fields to minimize payload size
- **Optimistic UI**: Immediate UI updates with rollback on failure
- **Debounced Requests**: Debounce search and filter operations
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management

**Performance Targets:**
- Initial page load: < 3 seconds on 3G connection
- Task list rendering: < 500ms for up to 200 tasks
- Task creation/update: < 200ms perceived response time
- Search results: < 1 second for any query

### 14. Data & Privacy

- No specific data retention requirements
- No HIPAA considerations (no PHI stored)
- US-based users only (no GDPR compliance required)
- Users can delete accounts via settings portal
- All account deletions are final
- Terms of Service and Privacy Policy required

#### 14.1 Privacy Best Practices

- **Data Minimization**: Only collect data essential for application functionality
  - Required: Email, name, clinic name, target launch date
  - Optional: Clinic location, phone number
  - Never collect: SSN, financial information, personal health information
- **User Consent**: 
  - Clear opt-in for marketing communications during signup
  - Separate consent for product updates vs promotional emails
  - Easy opt-out mechanism in all communications
- **Data Retention Policy**:
  - Active user data: Retained as long as account is active
  - Deleted account data: Permanently purged within 30 days
  - Backup data: Retained for 90 days maximum for disaster recovery
  - Analytics data: Anonymized and aggregated, retained for 2 years
- **Data Access Controls**:
  - User data accessible only to authorized personnel on need-to-know basis
  - All data access logged and auditable
  - No sharing of user data with third parties except as required by law
- **Data Portability**: Users can export their data in JSON format
- **Privacy by Design**: 
  - Default privacy settings favor user privacy
  - Minimal data collection at signup
  - Clear privacy notices at point of data collection
- **Third-Party Integrations**:
  - ConvertKit integration: Only email and consent status shared
  - Analytics: Use privacy-focused analytics (no personal data tracking)
  - No social media tracking pixels or unnecessary third-party scripts

---

### 15. Lead Capture & Email Integration

- **Email Required**: All users must sign up with email
- **List Integration**: Connect to ConvertKit (now Kit.com)
- **Opt-In**: Include opt-in for updates during signup
- **CTAs**:
  - "Get more resources" link
  - Footer links to other tools from DirectCareTools.com
- **No Exit Intent**: Intentionally excluded to avoid annoying users

---

### 16. Future Enhancements / Upgrade Path

- **Donation Support**:
  - Link to Stripe-powered "Support the Developer" donation page
- **Content Upgrades**: Potential future addition of downloadable resources
- **Referral System**: To be handled via email sequences, not built into app

---

### 17. Design System & Styling

The application should maintain consistency with the DirectCareTools.com design system by using the following base CSS files as the foundation (and/or implementing the tailwind config file if utilizing tailwind), with AI models adding additional styles as needed:

**design-tokens.css**: styles/design-tokens.css
**base-ui.css**: styles/base-ui.css
**tailwind.config.js**: styles/tailwind.config.js

Any additional CSS should build upon these foundations while maintaining the same design principles and token usage.
