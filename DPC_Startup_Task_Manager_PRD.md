### 17. Design System & Styling

The application should maintain consistency with the DirectCareTools.com design system by using the following base CSS files as the foundation (and/or implementing the tailwind config file if utilizing tailwind), with AI models adding additional styles as needed:

**design-tokens.css**: styles/design-tokens.css
**base-ui.css**: styles/base-ui.css
**tailwind.config.js**: styles/tailwind.config.js

Any additional CSS should build upon these foundations while maintaining the same design principles and token usage.
